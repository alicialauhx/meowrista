        <h2>Matcha preparation tips</h2>
        <p>
            The most important tip for matcha preparation is to <b>NEVER use boiling water</b> to mix the matcha powder.
            This is because high temperatures can spoil the natural flavors of the matcha and cause it to be more bitter.
            Therefore, the optimal temperature for matcha preparation is around <b>70-80Â°C</b> to effectively dissolve the matcha powder while retaining its natural flavor.
            <br><br>
            It is often recommended to use <b>bamboo spoons / chashaku</b> for scooping the matcha powder because matcha powder is known to react negatively with metal surfaces,
            especially. <b>One small heap of powder</b> on a chashaku is equivalent to <b>1 g</b>,
            while <b>one teaspoon</b> is equivalent to <b>2g</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The standard matcha powder-to-water ratio is 2g to 70-80 ml of water. However,
            I personally go for 10 ml for every g of powder, e.g., 2 gs to 20ml, 4 gs to 40 ml, etc.,
            for a more concentrated flavor.
            <br><br>
            It is always recommended to use a <b>traditional bamboo whisk</b> to whisk the matcha.
            This is because the tips of the bamboo whisk are designed specifically to break down clumps.
            Before whisking, <b>ALWAYS soak the bamboo whisk in hot water (not boiling water)</b> for around 1 minute.
            This is because the bamboo tips are brittle when dry, so soaking helps them become more flexible during whisking.
            For new whisks, soak them in hot water for around 60-90 seconds for the tips to expand.

            To create a creamy texture for the matcha (microfoam), add a little water to the matcha powder and stir in a circular motion until
            a thick paste is formed. Then, add in more water and whisk vigorously (tips near the bottom of the bowl) for 30 seconds,
            then whisk gently (tips slightly nearer to the surface of the mixture) for 20 seconds, then stir the 
            surface of the mixture in a circular motion for 10 seconds to break the air bubbles.
            <br><br>
            To gain health benefits from the matcha, it is usually recommended to <b>avoid using dairy-based milk</b>, e.g., full-cream milk, for matcha lattes, 
            because it contains <b>casein</b>, which binds with the antioxidants in the matcha, potentially hindering absorption by the body.

        <h2>Cream preparation tips</h2>
        <p>
            Cream prothing is the process of aerating cream to create a light, airy, and often thickened texture.
            The fat content of the cream plays a crucial role, with higher-fat creams generally producing a richer,
            more stable foam. 
            <br><br>
            <b>A helpful tip for milk of choice:</b> Since all of my cream-based recipes use 
            a little milk, my recommendation is <b>barista-edition</b> milk because they are known to be blended 
            specifically for frothing purposes in cafes.
            It is personally recommended to use a <b>frother</b> to whisk the mixture to effectively
            create a creamy texture.
            <br><br>
            Aim to froth the mixture for a floating effect. In the beginning, position the end of the frother
            <b>near the bottom</b> of the frothing pitcher until you can see a vortex. <!--insert demo picture-->
            Swirl around until the mixture is well-mixed. After mixing, position the end of the frother 
            <b>near the surface of the mixture</b> to add air into the mixture. Alternate between positioning
            near the surface and near the bottom to mix in the air.
